### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

  name - name of the car    
  year - whaen is first available   
  selling_price - what is selling price which we can predict    
  km_driven - how many km was driven car     
  fuel - fuel type    
  seller_type - seller type     
  transmission - gear system    
  Owner - how many prvious owner of car     
For used motorcycle datasets please go to https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/motorcycle-dataset

Using Random Forest Regression my accuracy is somewhere around 0.9468014007217117.    
Also i deploy the model and all the file i already upload in car dekho file and my application is also there in app.py.
You are just understand the code and make your model and deploy them from understanding my code.    
Have a good luck and best wishes to deep into data science and machine learning world.
